# Hack-A-Roo-2019_Vipra:

We have built an uber style hailing app for the specific organization to provide convenient transportation for their customers. App should allow patrons to request a pickup. As soon as a request is sent with the location, the driver of the nearest shuttle will be notified of the pickup location. Once the driver accepts the pickup, it will automatically route the driver to the patronâ€™s location with the least distance and time option.
